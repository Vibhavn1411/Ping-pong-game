# Ping Pong Game

A simple Ping Pong game implemented using Python and the Turtle module.

## Features
- Two-player game
- Ball physics with collision detection
- Paddle movement for both players
- Score tracking and display

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The game uses the built-in Turtle module, so no additional installations are required.

## Files in the Repository
- `main.py` - The main game script that initializes and runs the game loop.
- `ball.py` - Handles the ball movement and collision logic.
- `paddle.py` - Defines the paddle and its movement.
- `scoreboard.py` - Manages score tracking and display.

## How to Play
1. Run `main.py` to start the game.
2. Player 1 controls the left paddle using the `W` (up) and `S` (down) keys.
3. Player 2 controls the right paddle using the `Up Arrow` (up) and `Down Arrow` (down) keys.
4. The game continues until one player wins by reaching the maximum score.

## Running the Game
Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```sh
python main.py
```
